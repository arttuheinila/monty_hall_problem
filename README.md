# monty_hall_problem
Based on the Monty Hall -program.

The premise is behind a game show where you have to guess between three doors to find your prize. Should you change your guess after been shown one wrong option and given the option to change your guess?

It turns out that you should. The program runs the simulation as many times as you like and it turns out you double your changes of guessing correctly by changing your guess
